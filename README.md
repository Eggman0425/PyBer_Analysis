# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the new analysis was to create a new DataFrame summarizing the ride-sharing data by city type, as well as a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

Rural city types had the lowest total rides and total drivers yet had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Suburban city types sat in the middle of the pack with the second-highest total rides and total drivers and the second-highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The highest total rides and total drivers was in urban city types, but they also had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

## Summary
Based on the results of this analysis, I would recommend some suggestions for each city type. First, I would increase the number of drivers for rural areas. With more drivers, the average fares would decrease making the total rides increase due to more accessibility and affordability. In suburban city types, I would decrease the cost of fare in hopes of increasing the total number of rides overall since there seem top be plenty of drivers. For urban city types there are more drivers than there are rides, so by decreasing the number of drivers there will be an increase in average fares.
